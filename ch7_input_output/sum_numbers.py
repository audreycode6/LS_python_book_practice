#  write a program that asks for two numbers from the user, 
# adds them, and then displays the result. 
# Put the following code in a new file called sum_numbers.py and then run it:

# Add 2 number inputs
number1 = input('Enter the first number: ')
number2 = input('Enter the second number: ')
sum = float(number1) + float(number2)

print(f'The numbers {number1} and {number2} add to {sum}')


# Multiply 2 number inputs
number3 = input('Enter the first number:\n')
number4 = input('Enter the second number:\n')
multiply = float(number3) * float(number4)
print(f'The number {number3} multiplied by the number {number4} equals: {multiply}!')
